FreeSpeak Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

	# python setup.py install

SYSTRAY ICON
To get tre trayicon working you must have installed gnome-python bindings, by
the way, if you don't want to install that bindings (because you don't have
gnome, for example), you can install the "standalone" trayicon module:

  # python setup.py build_trayicon

Then repeat the installation:
	
	# python setup.py install
