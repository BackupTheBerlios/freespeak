The project:
- Application. Holds all the necessary information for the application to run, and for other applications to make use of FreeSpeak as a library.
- A Translation factory, to create pages in the notebook. Mostly, it decides which one to choose if it's a text translation, a web translation or whatelse.
- The main window holds a Manager, which is the notebook managing the translations. It has only a GUI relevance.
- Each translation has a translator, which can either be a text or web one. It holds information on the possible "From" and "To" options. Its role is final but fundamental as it translates the text/web.
